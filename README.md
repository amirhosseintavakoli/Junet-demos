This repository contains a number of Jupyter Notebook files showcasing how to perform the common network analysis operations with [Junet](https://github.com/inguar/Junet.jl).

The files are fully viewable here on GitHub.
You can try them yourself at [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com)
or by [installing Julia and Junet](https://github.com/inguar/Junet.jl/blob/master/README.md#installation) onto your own computer.
